"""
What we are doing in line 15 is, say that the program has just been launched. Since there's
Singleton instance yet, multiple threads can simultaneously pass the previous conditional 
and reach the point almost at the same time. the first of them will acquire lock and will 
proceed further, while the rest will wait here.

After line 15, The first thread acquires the lock, creates the Singleton Instance. Once it
leaves the lock block, the thread that is waiting for the lock to release may then enter the
conditional statement. But since as previously, the singleton field is already initialized,
the thread won't create a new object.
